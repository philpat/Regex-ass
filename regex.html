  <p>Question 1: 
    Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must sup-
port an optional minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal dot,

and exponent notation—5e-3 or 1E10—again with an optional sign in front of
the exponent. Also note that it is not necessary for there to be digits in front
of or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone. That is, .5 and 5.
are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isn’t.
  </p>

  <p>Question 2: 
    Imagine you have written a story and used single quotation marks throughout
to mark pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace all the dialogue quotes
with double quotes, while keeping the single quotes used in contractions like
aren’t.
Think of a pattern that distinguishes these two kinds of quote usage and
craft a call to the replace method that does the proper replacement.
  </p>
  <p> Question 3: 
    Code golf is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular program
in as few characters as possible. Similarly, regexp golf is the practice of writing
as tiny a regular expression as possible to match a given pattern, and only that
pattern.
For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether any
of the given substrings occur in a string. The regular expression should match
only strings containing one of the substrings described. Do not worry about
word boundaries unless explicitly mentioned. When your expression works, see
whether you can make it any smaller.
1. car and cat
2. pop and prop
3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari
4. Any word ending in ious
5. A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
6. A word longer than six letters
7. A word without the letter e (or E)
  </p>
  <Script>
     // question 1

     /^[+-]?\d*\.?\d+(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?$/

// /^/ - matches the beginning of the string

// e.g
const regex = /^[+-]?\d*\.?\d+(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?$/;

const str = "480";

const toMatch = regex.test(str);

console.log(toMatch); // true

// Question 2

const text = "She said, 'I'm leaving home now to go to work.'"

const newText = text.replace(/(\w+\s)'(?!s)(\w+)/g, "\"$1\"$2")

console.log(newText) // She said, "I'm leaving home now to go to work."


// Question 3

// car and cat
[car|cat]

// pop and prop
{pop|pr?op}

// ferret, ferry, and ferrari
ferr(et|y|ari)

// Any word ending in ious
([\w*ious])

// A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
\s[.,:;]

// A word longer than six letters
\w{7,}

// A word without the letter e (or E)

\w[^eE]
